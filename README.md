# Word Salad v 0.1

## The What
"Word Salad" is a text-to-speech application with a twist: instead of using speech synthesis, it instead uses sentence mixing. By providing pre-recorded words as individual files, "Word Salad" is able to assemble sentences to play back as audio. Perfect for Twitch redeems and the like! 

## The Why
Text-to-speech is a common redeem that I see on many channels. However, I feel that the open-ended nature encourages people to say whatever intrusive thought crosses their mind, with little concern for length or disruption. By restricting the pool of available words, the chatter is now presented with a fun puzzle: to say anything coherent at all feels like a small victory. It's good for the mind and soul.
